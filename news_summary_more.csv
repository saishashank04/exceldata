,,"On June 30, 1971, the only deaths in space occurred when three Soviet cosmonauts were returning from first-ever space station Salyut-1. The crew was found dead on opening their space capsule despite a perfect automated landing. An investigation revealed a valve had ruptured during undocking from Salyut-1, which led to depressurisation and sudden death before the capsule entered Earth's atmosphere."

,,"In a first, US-based scientists mixed lab-grown human cells with chicken embryos, where human cells directed them to grow into nervous tissue. Scientists said the research could lead to new ways of preventing miscarriages and birth defects. Although the hybrids didn't last long, Twitter users slammed the experiment saying, ""I don't care if you're trying to cure diseases, it's inappropriate."""

,,"According to reports, Kolkata Knight Riders' cheerleaders are the highest paid of all the franchises in IPL. The KKR cheerleaders are paid $300 (nearly â¹20,400) per person for a match, with a $100 bonus if the side wins the match. Kolkata, like all teams in IPL, played 14 group matches, and won eight of them to reach the playoffs."
,,"Karnataka Congress MLA DK Shivakumar has said the alliance with JD(S) was ""very, very hard"" and hurt the Congress workers since they fought like warriors in the elections and now have to ""sail together"". Claiming that a lot of cases were filed against his family under the previous JD(S) government, he said personal interests cannot be prioritised over national interests."

,,"India's benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gained for the ninth straight session today, posting their longest winning streak in more than three years. Sensex ended 89.63 points higher at 34,395 and Nifty rose 20.35 points to close at 10,548. This came as consumer stocks gained after the Meteorological Department forecast that India will have a normal monsoon."
